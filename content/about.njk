        <h1>About Caliper</h1>
        <p class="indent">Caliper Literary Magazine is Stuyvesant High School's oldest publication, dating back to 1906. With
            over a century of literary and artistic development, Caliper has cemented a place in Stuyvesant's creative community. In
            a school often focused on STEM, Caliper aims to create and maintain a supportive haven for writers and artists to
            collaborate, grow, and inspire one another. Aside from its biannual publication, Caliper offers weekly workshops led by
            editors in art and creative writing, often focusing on specific genres, mediums, techniques, and prompts. Recent
            workshops have touched on ekphrastic poetry, surrealism, collage, and short stories. Each semester culminates in a
            printed edition of student work, curated by Caliper editors. All students are invited to submit to the magazine, and are
            welcome to attend feedback sessions in the weeks leading up to the submission deadline. Caliper is grateful for funding
            from the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association.
