        <h1>Submitting to Caliper</h1>
        <p>Caliper Literary Magazine opens its call for submissions at the end of each semester. All Stuyvesant
            students are welcome to submit, but only Caliper members are guaranteed to be published. Caliper members are expected to
            attend at least three meetings per semester. Towards the end of each semester, Caliper will attach its submission form
            here on the website, as well as send out emails, post on social media, hang up flyers around the school, and announce
            deadlines on the morning announcements.
